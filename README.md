### Acknowledgments & References

The gold pan item in this mod are inspired by the excellent gold pan item from [TerraFirmaCraft](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft). TerraFirmaCraft is an outstanding total conversion mod that brings realistic survival mechanics to Minecraft, and their innovative approach to resource gathering has been a significant source of inspiration for our mod's design.

We deeply appreciate the TerraFirmaCraft team's dedication to creating immersive and realistic gameplay experiences. Their work has set a high standard for survival mechanics in Minecraft modding, and we're honored to build upon their concepts while adding our own unique twist.
